Suhan L. is originally of Chinese heritage. He joined Arenztopia and was the former Prime Minister of Arenztopia until the Prime Minister position was removed. After losing his post as Prime Minister, he defaulted to the terrorist organization Milestopia and threatened to bomb Arenztopia; he was later put in jail but escaped and went undercover. Suhan was accepted back into Arenztopia after begging for admission in late 2020. Since his re-admission, he has become the self-declared Secretary of STEM, and he also created the website of Arenztopian Airlines. His re-admission was a contreversial move, as Suhan has glorified himself and made a series of false claims since he was re-admitted.
