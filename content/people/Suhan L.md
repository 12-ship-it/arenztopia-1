Suhan Li is a conflicted figure in Arenztopian politics, having served as the first and only Prime Minister of Arenztopia from the middle of January 2020 until the removal of the Prime Minister post in the middle of March 2020. After he was forced to resign, he threatened to bomb Arenztopia, so he was put in jail. However, less than a week later he broke out when an enemy helicopter airlifted him out of the prison. He has been loyal to the enemy of Arenztopia, Milestopia, which is a terrorist organization. Suhan is on a "arrest on sight" order for the OCPD.
