Suhan L. is originally of Chinese heritage. He joined Arenztopia and was the former Prime Minister of Arenztopia until the Prime Minister position was removed. After losing his post as Prime Minister, he defaulted to the terrorist organization Milestopia and threatened to bomb Arenztopia; he was later put in jail but escaped and went undercover. Suhan was accepted back into Arenztopia in late 2020. Since his re-admission, he has become the Secretary of Science & Technology and he also created Arenztopian Airlines. His re-admission was a vital move, as Suhan has greatly helped Arenztopia's tourism and medical tech.
