The Arenztopian Government has reluctantly let multiple siblings of Arenztopian Citizens and/or sibling friends to join our great nation because every one is welcome. BUT. We want them to stay anonymous since siblings are rarely allowed to join. Currently we have let in 6 siblings who may one day have their names displayed.
