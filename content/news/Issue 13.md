## Feature: Joe Biden
by Renzo Avila

We sat down with The presendent-elect of the United States, Former VP Joe Biden over zoom. Arenztopian leaders have been very happy about the choice, formerly Trump tried taking Arenztopia back into the USA as a territory, very soon after we became our own country.
Biden told us about what changes he will be making and if it will affect Arenztopia. "I believe that now, with Trump gone, we will be able to open trade routes more. We hope that we can help fix this fractured relationship between our two countries that was broken after me and Mr. Obama left office. I hope we will become as close as we were when I helped release you from the US."
Ammost 95% of Arenztopians support this government change. King Renzo and many of his close circle have announced their support, as have many other world leaders. Mr. Biden also noted "We miss the relationship we had and hope to rebuild our freindship with many other countries in this world. We are all humans and all deserve a chance."
