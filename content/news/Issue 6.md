## Crazy!
by Tony Yuan

Merdwif Mental Hospital-A man was analyzed by police and psycologists and deemed to have lost all reason as a result of intensive total self-isolation. The man, who is known by the name Steve Jobink, was reported to a mental hospital, the police, and a psychologist after he started to "yell and pull his hair out", according to his wife. Police are investigating if there are other cases, and if so how to prevent them. Mr. Jobink was put in a straitjacket and transported to Merdwif Mental Hospital on Friday where he is under constant observation by a specially appointed team of psycologists and therapists, and the hospital's administrators say he will be ready and normal in "less than a year".
