## Fatal Car Crash
By Tony Yuan

AR-10-On Tuesday, a fatal car crash occured on AR-10, which involved two semi trucks and a sedan, and killed 3 people. According to footage, one of the semi trucks seems to have accidentally swerved into the wrong lane, but when the driver realized the mistake, he tried to swerve into the lane that he was in before. The semi truck ran over a sedan that was in its path, and another semi truck was hit by the first semi truck's  trailer as it fell over. After the first semi truck hit the sedan, it flipped over and burst into flames, revealing the crushed sedan. The sedan exploded as well a couple of minutes later, and the explosion flung it into a ditch in the side of the road.![The sedan after the car crash.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vT4EGGvdDnPfHalKvpeNHoTMof9rMUw_7qYVlzCjiUQBWY81iWChK16eaVtIHuUsqq3YvBDeajTt5i9/pub?w=960&h=720)
