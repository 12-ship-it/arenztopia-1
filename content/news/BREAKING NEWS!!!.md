One, named Bob Richy, commented "I am not scared for me, I am scared for my family." Top Detectives are on the case. Some think they are the same robbers that stole a priceless painting from the Arenztopia Treasury. [Issue 7] (Issue 7, Arts section) King LSJA says: "We will find them, we are safe, stay calm."
