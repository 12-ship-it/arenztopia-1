## Huge new oil deposit found
by Tony Yuan

Sar Basin-On Wednesday, an oil platform hit upon a gigantic underground pool of oil on the north edge of the Sar Basin, a large underwater plain some 40 miles out from the coast. The oil platform, which was built in 2016 and chistened the Haruga, pumped in oil for over two hours before calling it a day. Research ships have determined that the huge resovior holds at least 10 billion gallons of oil, making it the second-largest oil resovoir ever found in Arenztopia. Arenztopia Oil Conglemerate (AOC) is expected to claim the northern side of the resovoir, while ArenzIro is expected to claim the southeast corner. The southwest corner may go to Iroil AZ, but that is not confirmed. The central area will be open to anybody.

Olb City Announcer: Could you briefly explain what Scientism is?

Doren Fu: Scientism is a satirical religion that believes in six core principles: First, everything anybody says has to be true. Second, the Earth is a two-dimensional octagon with the continents and oceans on its backside. Third, the Earth is trapped beneath a very large dome with holes poked in it. Fourth, the Sun is actually just a big basketball. Fifth, every fiction story is nonfiction and every nonfiction story is fiction. Finally, outside of the dome which the Earth is trapped under lies the Great and Heavenly Leader, the Great God Bous, who is all-seeing and all-knowing.

OCA: How did you come up with Scientism?

DF: So one day I was sitting in my house and this was back in April, and I was bored out of my mind, and I was reading this news story about a couple of guys who had started this religion which had over 100,000 people in two months. So I was like, "This is a great idea!" and I went and drafted some ridiculous and arbitrary ideas for a religion. Then, I published it to the world!

OCA: What is Scientism satirizing?

DF: Huh, that's a hard one. I suppose Scientism is satirizing un-scientific beliefs about our world, things like gods and flat earthers. And I think Scientism is also satirizing the fact that people love religion, that people will join a religion having no true idea of what they're getting into.

OCA: Thank you! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!

DF: Thank you, and I hope to see you soon!
