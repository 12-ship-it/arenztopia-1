## Huge new oil deposit found
by Tony Yuan

Sar Basin-On Wednesday, an oil platform hit upon a gigantic underground pool of oil on the north edge of the Sar Basin, a large underwater plain some 40 miles out from the coast. The oil platform, which was built in 2016 and chistened the Haruga, pumped in oil for over two hours before calling it a day. Research ships have determined that the huge resovior holds at least 10 billion gallons of oil, making it the second-largest oil resovoir ever found in Arenztopia. Arenztopia Oil Conglemerate (AOC) is expected to claim the northern side of the resovoir, while ArenzIro is expected to claim the southeast corner. The southwest corner may go to Iroil AZ, but that is not confirmed. The central area will be open to anybody.

## Feature: Sallo Doremia
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Sallo Doremia, the new CEO of ArenzIro, which is the third-largest oil company in Arenztopia. She is the first female CEO of ArenzIro.

Olb City Announcer: Could you briefly explain what ArenzoIro is?

Sallo Doremia: ArenzIro is an oil company, and we mine oil! (laughter) We get a lot of inquiries about our name, and it's just Arenz and then Iro, which is Arenzese for Oil.

OCA: What policies are you planning in your term as CEO?

SD: So I'm planning a bunch of diversifying acts, such as changing the Board of Directors, and I would also improve and maintain our oil rigs, after we found that the individual rig managers were not keeping the oil rigs sanitary or clean. So yeah, definetely some diversity and some housekeeping, or rig-keeping, as we call it. (laughter)

OCA: What do you think about the new oil resovoir that was found on Wednesday?

SD: I think that this is a good opportunity for profits, but I also think that the other companies, Iroil AZ especially, should be more careful this time of what their environmental impact is.

OCA: Thank you! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!

SD: Thank you for inviting me here! I had a great time.
