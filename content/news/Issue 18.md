## Famous Athlete Missing
by Tony Yuan

Marifu Hills-Famous soccer player Luke Jasil went missing on Wednesday. Police say he disappeared from his home at night. Officials think that he was kidnapped. The OCPD has published five suspects on its website at [ocpd.org/suspects](ocpd.org/suspects). "This is an act of grevious cowardice," Jack Carter, the leader of the Olb City Detective Association, said in a statement. Forensic scientists have roped off Jasil's home and are searching for evidence. In a statement, they said that they had found several incomplete fingerprints, but not enough to determine the kidnapper. Police have also speculated that the kidnapping was motivated by Jasil's intense opposition of the terrorist group Milestopia.

A new tapestry was unveiled for the growing and trending exhibit at the OCAM, Weaving Magic. It is billed as "The largest tapestry in Olb City!" and that is actually true. The gargantuan, whose actual title is "Woodland Scene with Deer and Rabbits," was weaven by renowned tapestry artist Pedro Sacala in 1735. At 75 feet by 50 feet, it took 10 years to compete and was previously stored at the Arenztopia City Museum of Art.
