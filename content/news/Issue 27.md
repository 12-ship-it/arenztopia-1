A new artwork was unveiled at the OCAM on Monday. It is by previously unknown artist Georgio Kanhalkanazzar. It features a huge LED screen that visitors can walk on, and the screen displays various optical illusions as the day progresses. N1 News' art reviews section has described it as "dizzying fun."

## Sports

On Sunday, the Super Bowl happened over in the United States. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady went up against the Kansas City Cheifs and Patrick Mahomes. It was a very one-sided fight, with a gigantic loss for the Cheifs. A quick analysis shows that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defense always tackled Mahomes before he could make a focused throw, and the Cheifs didn't ever get a single touchdown. The final score was 31-9.

## Feature: Telta Williams
By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Telta Williams, the founder and CEO of Telta Tech, a company that focuses on air travel.

Olb City Announcer: Hi! thanks for coming! Can you tell us a little bit about Telta Tech?

Telta Williams: Sure! Telta Tech is a company that makes and uses our air travel for the better of the planet and humanity.

OCA: That is awesome! What was your most recent project?

TW: Well, we are working on some projects right now, but we can't tell you about that till it is released! But, one project recently released was the Planes for Humanity project or PHP. We use our planes to carry food to less-fortunate families in places like Uganda, Ethiopia, Yemen, and many African countries: A single freighter 747 can carry over 120 tons of food. We also use our other aviation tech, mostly our drones, to plant trees in areas where forests are being cut down. 

OCA: WOW! you and your company seem to be working very hard to help this planet! What do you use your money for?

TA: Well, first from what I just told you we don't make a whole lot of money on things like PHP but, we sell out tech to some companies that we know use out tech for good. But, anyway we make monthly about 1 billion dollars, which is a lot. After paying my employees, keeping our tech up to standards, and the cost of the saplings, and the food we give, we have about 100 million left. I donate 50 million to childrens' hospitals, 25 million to ocean clean-up programs and then I have 25 million left. Of course after I work pretty hard I like to keep 10 million myself. I keep the last 15 million for future projects.

OCA: Sounds like you're very smart with your money! Anyway, thanks for coming!

TA: Thanks for inviting me! Bye!
