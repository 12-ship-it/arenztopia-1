## Blackout
by Tony Yuan

South Olb City Electricity Center-On Tuesday, a blackout happened that affected half a million people in South Olb City. The blackout was caused by several wires failing at South Olb City Electricity Center. Many people reported a sudden extinguishing of their lights at about 10:00 in the morning. The ISS also captured a measurement of about a third of the electricity of Olb City shutting off. Some people in Central Olb City also reported a slight dimming of their lights. By 2:00 in the afternoon, the electricity was up and running again. The Olb City Manager of Utilities, John Kerbae, issued a statement on Wednesday that outlined the cause of the blackout, the number of people affected, and that "We will be executing a comprehensive review of all of our power stations."

## Feature: Doren Fu
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Doren Fu, the leader of the new, trending religion of Scientism.

Olb City Announcer: Could you briefly explain what Scientism is?

Doren Fu:  

OCA: Could you explain the satellites in more detail?

FN: Sure! So these satellites, they were launched back in 2017. Each one of the APAIS satellites is about the size of a small van, and they contain many different types of cameras and scientific instruments. The APAIS satellites, once they reach the asteroid, they attempt to orbit it. After that, they orbit the asteroid for three or four Earth years, taking precise measurements, taking pictures, and hopefully with APAIS-3, getting samples.

OCA: Why did you select Vesta and Pallas as the go-to asteroids?

FN: Well, Vesta is the second-biggest thing, and the biggest asteroid, in the Asteroid Belt. So it has a lot of building space. It also may have precious metals that we can mine.
As for Pallas, it's also pretty big, and is confirmed to be chock-full of minerals and precious metals.

OCA: Thank you! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!

FN: Thanks for inviting me!
