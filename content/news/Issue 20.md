Claire P. won a third term as Advisor, and the senators are James O., Charlotte H, and Michael A. Cheif Judge is Kassie K., and there will be a runoff for the other judges next month.

Famous street artist Kahn Cankam rolled his newest art piece into the middle of Olb Plaza during the dead of night on Tuesday. The sculpture is a huge wooden horse covered in colorful geometric patterns. Titled "Trojan Horse," the new installation caused a sensation when everybody woke up on Wednesday. "I was actually quite shocked," says Mercine Darasen, a citizen. "I mean, I wake up and there's this huge colorful horse staring at me through my window."

Tropical Storm Vonso touched land on Wednesday after briefly strengthening to a Category 1 Hurricane on Tuesday. Austerfeild was hit first and reported stong winds of up to 79 mph and heavy rain, but no casualities and only minor damage such as branches breaking off and shingles blowing away. In other news, temperatures have fallen to -2 and -3 degrees, and meteorologists predict that Tropical Storm Vonso might actually bring ice, hail, snow and sleet instead of rain.
