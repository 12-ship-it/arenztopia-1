## Silver Growing In Crystals
by Tony Yuan

Albrecht Cave-Miners using enimulgemid etatetnepodag disulfate technology were able to bust the entire back and half of the side walls of Albrecht Cave. Seeing a narrow tunnel, one of the miners climbed into the tunnel. Emerging in a giant cavern, he saw silver everywhere, except these were growing in huge, diamond and quartz style crystals! Having never seen this before, the miner called the other people over to see while he called the ASO (Arenzish Scientific Office). Experts and scientists the country over are peering, poking, and testing samples of this bizzare phenomenon. Alex DuChiniko, a scientist and one of the nation´s leading experts on precious metals, says ¨I´ve never seen anything like it. Silver just isn´t supposed to do this!¨ Says a spokesperson for the ASO, ¨We could be on the brink of a scientific revolution that changes our understanding of the elements.¨

## New Dinosaur Discovered
by Tony Yuan

A new dinosaur was unearthed a couple of miles away in the coast region. Called Thanos Dysprositosarus, it is a large tyrannosaur. It is the second species in the Thanos genus, which is named after the comic book charachter. The species name, Dysprositosarus, means ¨hard to get at lizard¨, because Dysprositos is the greek word for ¨hard to get at¨. It is named this way because it was found in really hard rocks.

## Social Distancing: How it affects rats
by Max Supresey, Director of psycology at the ASO

The ASO (Arenzish Scientific Office)´s department of psycology conducted a study on rats during social distancing. They acquired 50 lab rats and put them in a box, then separated each rat from the others with a round partition. Then, they monitored the rat´s brains for a month. After a month had passed, the psycologists had the rats solve basic puzzles that they also solved before social distancing. The data shows that the rats were able to solve a greater number of puzzles, but they did it slower.
