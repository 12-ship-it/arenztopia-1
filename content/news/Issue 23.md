# The Olb City Announcer
Volume 3, Issue 3    
January 10th-January 16th, 2021

Dear Viewers,

On 1/20/2021, Tony Yuan has commited crime. He as vice president, intentionally removed all of Suhan Li's data. A heavy foul! As a result, the Olb City annoucer will be paused to figure Tony's highly significant heavy crime!

Good day,
Suhan Li & Lorenzo Avila
