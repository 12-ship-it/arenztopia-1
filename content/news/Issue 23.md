The Sherville Sharks raced against the New Athens Arctic Foxes in the first game of the professional bobsledding season. The Arctic Foxes were soundly beaten by the Sherville Sharks, which comes as no surprise: The Sharks hold the record for fastest bobsled in Arenztopia (Top speed: 170 mph) and are also widely considered to be one of the best bobsledding teams in the world. Three of their team players have gotten Olympic gold medals, and they have won the last two Arenztopian Professional Bobsledding Tournaments in a row.

Hurricane Vonso suddenly decreased in intensity as it left Olb City; it is now a tropical storm. Preliminary reports say that the city suffered moderate damage, with tree branches breaking off and some shingles falling off of roofs. During the last day of Tropical Storm Vonso's passover, it brought down sleet, which means that there are also some dents in cars. The Anda Dam's gates were at full open to avoid damage from the little pieces of ice brought by the sleet, and the total causuality count is three injuries, mostly from being hit by branches and sleet. The average temperature for next week is supposed to be a cool -3 degrees.
