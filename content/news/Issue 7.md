## Giant Meteor Seen Over Olb City
by Tony Yuan    

Lower West Quarter-A huge meteor, dubbed HIO-20201862DDES, was seen streaking through the air in the evening on Tuesday. HIO-20201862DDES was detected by the Arenztopian satellite known as HIO. It came from the Oort Cloud and was observed in one part of its 1,534,702-year orbit, but a gravitational disruption due to the reversal of the magnetic feilds of Mars caused it to veer onto a collision course with Earth. The meteor was estimated to be about 100 meters in diameter. It broke up in the atmosphere and several chunks caused minor damage to homes and cars. The ASA is currently studying the rock for any precious metals or signs of extraterrestrial life. One peice is to be displayed at the seasonal exhibition "Rocks of the Cosmos: A journey through the amazing world of space rocks" in 2021 at the Olb City Natural History Museum in 2022.

Two robbers stole a priceless peice from the Arenztopian Treasury on Monday. Top detectives are on the case but no suspects have been found. We will have an update next week.

On Thursday, the University of Arenztopia at Natania City announced that it would be opening its stadium, Brookers Field, and it would have a football game against the New Paris Panthers. On Friday, the night of the game, Brookers Field was packed with adoring fans. The Natania City Narwhals won 15-14, but over 30 people contracted the coronavirus as a result of going to the game. The University quickly closed Brookers Field and paid compensation to the famillies of the people who contracted COVID-19.
