## Giant Meteor Seen Over Olb City
by Tony Yuan    

Lower West Quarter-A huge meteor, dubbed HIO-20201862DDES, was seen streaking through the air in the evening on Tuesday. HIO-20201862DDES was detected by the Arenztopian satellite known as HIO. It came from the Oort Cloud and was observed in one part of its 1,534,702-year orbit, but a gravitational disruption due to the reversal of the magnetic feilds of Mars caused it to veer onto a collision course with Earth. The meteor was estimated to be about 100 meters in diameter. It broke up in the atmosphere and several chunks caused minor damage to homes and cars. The ASA is currently studying the rock for any precious metals or signs of extraterrestrial life. One peice is to be displayed at the seasonal exhibition "Rocks of the Cosmos: A journey through the amazing world of space rocks" in 2021 at the Olb City Natural History Museum.

## SEYR Foods, Inc goes bankrupt
by Owen Miyazoi

SEYR Foods, Inc, one of the largest food distributors in Arenztopia, filed for level 5 bankruptcy on Tuesday as a result of the pandemic. SEYR Foods, Inc, the food subsidary of the Argen Group, distributed 50% of the food from Nutrifood Farms last year. However, in light of the worsening pandemic, it declared a temporary shutdown last month in order to regroup its stocks and reorganize its employees. After going back on the market two weeks ago, its stocks fell another 1000 dollars, and it withdrew from the market and declared bankruptcy. The Argen Group issued a press release on Friday stating that it had received 100 million Arenzos collectively from a range of companies and funds, including Nutrifood Farms, and that it would be using this money to restart SEYR Foods and bring it back onto the market. The Argen Group also said that it would be open to receiving money until December 20th.
