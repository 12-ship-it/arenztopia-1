## Ship Collision in Arenztopia Bay 
By Tony Yuan

Arenztopia Bay-A freighter collided with another freighter in Arenztopia Bay on Tuesday. Over 300 containers were lost and 12 injuries were reported, with no deaths yet. The control center at Arenztopia Bay issued a detailed report several hours after the crash, which says that the freighter *Marice* steamed into the bay, and collided head-on with the *Albatross*, which was heading out of the bay. *Marice* tipped over, and some of her containers fell and sunk. The *Albatross* suffered a gash on its front and took on water until it, too, sunk. The capsized *Marice* was towed out of the bay after its crew was rescued, and the *Albatross*' engine exploded after most of its crew was also rescued. The lost cargo is estimated to be worth up to 13 million dollars, and includes food, machine parts, and wood. The cause of the crash has been determined to be poor judgement on the part of the captains.
