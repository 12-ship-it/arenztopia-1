## Plane crashes near airport hotel
By Tony Yuan

Olb City International Airport-A Boeing 727 overshot the runway at OCIA on Monday and broke apart after hitting the ground and exploding just 50 meters from the Hilton at OCIA. Police say that at least 20 people have died, 50 are injured, and the rest are missing. The wreckage of the plane was quickly doused with water and investigators are now searching for clues as to what might have caused the crash. Data obtained from the control tower at OCIA show that the airplane attempted to land on the wrong runway and that both the pilot and co-pilot were extremely inexperienced. The plane was operated by AAL, and federal authorities are now conducting an investigation into that airline company. "This is a very sad crash, and I hope that stuff like this won't happen again," said Suhan Li, CEO of AAL. We'll be publishing a follow-up story in tomorrow's issue as new details emerge.
