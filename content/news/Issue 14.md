## APAIS-2 reaches asteroid
by Tony Yuan

Derlass Space Facility-The revolutionary satellite APAIS-2 (All-Purpose Asteroid Imaging System) reached the asteroid Vesta on Tuesday after a journey of more than three years. It will orbit the asteroid for four Earth years collecting data about Vesta. This will help astronomers assess if Vesta will be suitable for a future mission. "We are eyeing the Asteroid Belt as a potential destination for intergalactic explorers after stopping at Mars, which could become a 'gas station' for future missions," the Arenztopian Officer of Science, Tony Yuan, said. APAIS-2 is the second satellite in the APAIS sieries. Its predecessor, APAIS-1, launched in 2008 and studied another asteroid, Pallas, until 2014.

## Feature: Jack Ma
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Jack Ma, the richest person in China and the owner of Ant Group, which is a subsidiary of his company Alibaba. Ant Group has announced its intentions to start a massive, 626 billion Arenzo IPO sometime next week.

Olb City Announcer: So tell us a little bit about your upcoming IPO.

Jack Ma: So first I want to tell people what an IPO is. It's an event where a company goes public, basically. So what everybody means by biggest IPO is that Ant Group is going to be worth the most money when it goes public.

OCA: What are the potential implications of this IPO?

JM: So first, it would add a lot more value to the Chinese stock market. Also, it would hopefully make Ant Group or ALibaba grow in size through trading.

OCA: What are you planning to do with all the extra money, if there is any?

JM: I want to give it to small buisenesses; they're the ones who need it the mot, espcially during the pandemic.

OCA: Thanks! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!

JM: Thank you!
