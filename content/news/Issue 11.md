## Olb City Manager of Health Arrested
by Tony Yuan

Servan Wayazoya, the Manager of Health in Olb City, was arrested and fired on Tuesday on multiple counts of tax evasion, shoplifting, and misinformation. He went on trial on Wednesday, and was found guilty of evading taxes for the entire year of 2018, shoplifting a local Walmart twice in 1998 and stealing over 1,500 Arenzos worth of goods, and spreading coronavirus conspiracy theories on Facebook. Mr. Wayazoya was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 2.5 years of community service. Olb City announced that it was looking for a new candidate for the post on Friday, and said that, due to the urgent coronavirus situation at hand, there would be an interim Manager of Health named Frank Holoneb, who is an accomplished virologist. "This shows the extent of criminal activity in the Olb City government", Mayor Yuan said on Thursday. "We will be executing a comprehensive purge of the Olb City cabinet."
