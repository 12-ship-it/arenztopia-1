# General Information
The Arenztopian island resides off the coast of Mexico. The king is Lorenzo Sebastian Javier Avila, Supreme Monarch Of the Country Of Arenztopia, and he lives in Arenztopia City, which is located next to the Bay of Arenztopia at the southeast corner of the island. The 50 million people on the island enjoy a plentiful economy of $5 trillion and lots of beautiful cities. The major cities are Arenztopia City, Olb City, Noi City, Austerfeild, Arville, Shersville, New Athens, New Austin, Sitin, Shreet, New Rome, and New Paris. Symbols of Arenztopia include a horse (the national animal) and ice cream, which is the national food. The people speak Arenzese, English, and Spanish. Mount Arenztopia is the highest spot, at an astounding 20,100 feet. On the contrary, the lowest point is in the Arenztopian Desert at 200 feet below sea level. The country´s motto is We Love Books, but the more commonly used version is the Arenzese, Dv Olev Yllph. The currency of Arenztopia is called the Arenzo. One arenzo is equal to 50 cents USD. All stores will accept it, and most people use it. It is unique in that it is completely digital-no paper bills or coins involved.

Arenztopia is home to many cities. Arenztopia City is the largest, at nearly 2 million people in population, and there are many semi-autonomous city-states within Arenztopia, including Hasiania, Chasiania, Rohadden, Iremdor, and Aradakon, which are tax-free entities that compete in Arenztopian sporting activities. They are areas that did not agree to the 2020 American Treaty and so became their own semi-autonomous entities. The smallest city is Cuyanting, with a population of just 2,500 people.  

# Political Structure
There is a king, who is voted into place, and who follows a constitution. The Vice President is also voted into place and will become the new interim king in wake of the king suddenly resigning or dying. There are also 3 judges in the Supreme Court, and three senators. The judges function much like the Supreme Court of the USA, handling high-level cases and approving laws. The senators propose laws and perform other executive duties. Finally, the Executive Branch, consisting of the King, the Vice President, and the advisors, organizes the political ecosystem and keeps things in order, as well as making top-level desicions and passing laws. There is also a House of Representatives, which contains one representative from every state and region. They represent the state's intentions and propose bills.

There are two main parties: 

The Ethics Party, which values ethics over science. For example, if killing an animal is necessary for an experiment, as long as the animal is not absolutely necessary to the experiment, an Ethics person will not kill it. However, Ethics people are not vegetarians, because they think that animals can be eaten.

The Science Party, which values science over ethics. A Science person will kill an animal even if it is not absolutely necessary to the experiment.

All independents are grouped into the Red Party.

Laws are approved by this process: First, a group of citizens or a politician proposes a bill. If the bill is on a level lower than national, the citizens in the area that is affected by the bill vote on it. If it wins the vote, the leaders of the affected area review it again, then the bill is apporved and passed into law. If the bill affects the entire nation, it goes to the senate. The senators look at the bill and make sure that it is reasonable and can be implemented, and if the bill is passed, it goes to the Executive Branch. The King, the advisors, and the Vice President look over the bill and see if it improves the situation oof the country and if it fits the interests of the people. After that, the bill goes to the Judicial Branch, which are the judges, who make sure that it is constitutional, then they will officially pass the bill into law.

# Political Alignment
Arenztopia is a military ally to the numerous city-states within it, and also to the USA, Japan, France, England, Spain, Germany, Russia, China, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Italy, The Holy See, and Canada.

Arenztopia does not have any enemies yet, except for the short-lived chaos organization Chickentopia and the terrorist group Milestopia.
