##  History part 1: The Incas


In the year 1470, the great Incan emperor Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui sent a fleet of ships out from Cusco to explore new lands. The explorers, after venturing for about 500 miles out from shore, ran headfirst into a gigantic storm. It wrecked 3 of their ships and killed a dozen men, and the remaining people were forced to turn back. About a week later the brisk gale powered their crafts to a mysterious island. This island was Arenztopia.

##  Incan Rule 


This storm is called the Tlwh´ yovhhrmt (gods´ blessing) in the folk tales. But the real gods´ blessing for these weary Incan travellers was the extremely fertile soil their scouts reported. Legend has it that the leader of the expiditionaries fell to his knees and said ¨Agradiseyki Inti, chaypas nogakuna munay llapa tiyay hamchi¨(a rough translation of praise Inti* for we will all be saved!) and started sobbing. The men made a large offering, and then gratefully planted wheat while some people set out to notify the emperor. Over the next 60 years the emperor visited several times and Arenztopia was built up into a bountiful asset. Then, sixty-three  years after that fateful storm-the Tlwh´ yovhhrmt-Francisco Pizzaro came along and felled the mighty Inca Empire.

Spainish rule had begun.

*Inti was the king of the gods in the Inca empire.
