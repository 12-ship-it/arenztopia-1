# National Parks

Arenztopia has many national parks governed under the Arenztopia National Park Service and the Arenztopian Office of National Parks. They are a major tourist attraction in Arenztopia.

## Tfziwrzmh National Park

Tfziwrmh National Park covers almost the entire Mountain Region and the mountain range known as The Tfziwrzmh, or The Guardians in English.

There are Ranger Centers and Park Offices at Mount Bimazarii, Aurem Peak, Tritonaig Peak, Mount Tanzeuniak, Craland Meadow, Kinian Lake, Seiracosmo Meadow, Holamistera Lake, and Roesia Meadow. There are Wildlife Spotting Stations at each of these Ranger Stations and at Smithyorkinag Valley, Mount Nishforth, and Wyndmon Valley. Many tour guides offer tours of the park and there is also a dedicated community of guides that are ready to guide someone on a journey up one of the 1,836 named mountains and peaks of the mountain range. 

The main road artery, Park Road 101, runs along the park and has other park roads sprouting from it. The park roads that are normally of interest to tourists are Park Road 1201, which winds up the lower part of the park's highest mountain, Mount Tenephur; Park Road 601, which runs past the famous trio of mountains called the Rukranedia Trinity and then goes around the site of the famous Battle of Tfziwrzmh, fought at Cakittinanp Valley. The battlefeild is considered one of the most senic spot in the park; and Park Road 1601, which is a rugged road reaching deep into the mountains through the tundra and past many glaciers. 

There are many wolves and hawks throughout the park, and you can spot them year-round at the Wildlife Spotting Stations. In the lakes, there are many fish, including trout, bass, salmon, and a unique freshwater pufferfish endemic to Baiai Lake, but only Saint Barthe Lake and Tufolk Lake are open to fishing.

Thereare multiple lodges and hotels throughout the park, with most of them being in the city of New Paris. The best hotel around the park but not in New Paris is the Mountain Wolf Lodge ($). The Mountain Wolf Lodge has great views over the mountain range and is very accesible from and to the entire park. Their average nightly rates go between 50$ and 200$. Another one that's in New Paris is the Grande Hotel ($$), a jewel of 1930s highway attractions. It has an acclaimed hot-off-the-grill complimentary breakfast service and all rooms have views over either the quaint skyline of New Paris, the mountain range, or spectacular and pristine new Paris Lake. Nightly rates average at about 150$ to 250$. If you happen to be looking for a more rugged residence, try the critically acclaimed Nlfmgzrm Ivzgivzg (English: "Mountain Retreat")($), which is housed in a structure that was hewn right into the rock face. It has bare-rock floors and walls and coarse wooden beds, plus a fireplace, in each room, but that's all. The complimentary breakfast consists of corn and grains with natural deer meat, which is what the earliest Tfziwrmh settlers ate 300 years ago. The hotel is located in a remote corner of the park above the treeline. Nightly rates range from 15$ to 50$.

There are many, many restauraunts throughout the park and in New Paris, but the best and most critically acclaimed one is in the heart of New Paris. The restauraunt is called Thander-Bronspri and Sons.($$) and is known for Chickpea and Haddock Penne served sizzling and fresh on a skillet. It's one of the oldest restauraunts in Northeast Arenztopia, having been founded in 1706 during Philip V's rule (see the [History](https://www.arenztopia.com/history/) section) by Eduardo Thander-Bronspri VI. The restauraunt also serves a variety of regional delicacies, such as roasted bear with fresh trout garnished with courgette, beetroot salad with elderflower dressing, or venison and mushroom risotto soaked in sweet corn juice. Another great restauraunt is Greenway Cooking New Paris ($$), which is a modern, chic eatery housed in a warehouse east of New Paris. It serves progressive, locally-inspired dishes like mushroom and rabbit fusilli in a pumpkin sauce with a hard-boiled egg on top, or avocado and wild carrot salad with caviar garnish. However, if you're looking for a cheaper option, you can try Skavadsmarle ($), which is a quaint, homey little café tucked into Greater Trailmire Valley. They have traditional, hearty foods such as venison and rye bread with onion stew, duck and acorn stew, or venison and potato skewers.

## James O. National Park

James O. National Park is a medium-sized national park situated on the border between Ensley, also known as the national forest, and the Arenztopian Desert. Many endangered species reside within its borders. It's named after James O., a wealthy and influential Arenztopian senator. 

There are Ranger Centers and Park Offices at the Al-Hyynb Dunes, Siverat Grove, East Hernandez River Crossing, West Hernandez River Crossing, Nollile Cabins, Caasen Oases Group, and Droutreanap Watering Hole. There are Wildlife Spotting Stations at each of these Ranger Centers and Park Offices except for the Al-Hyynb Dunes and West Hernandez River Crossing stations. Guides offer tours of both the forest and desert sections of the park.

The main road artery, Park Road 102, curves in an S shape through the middle of the park. This road provides great access to many of the best spots in the park, but more great options include Park Road 1402, which follows Hernandez River to the edge of the park; Park Road 902, which comprehensively tours the desert section of the park; Park Road 1002, which meanders around the foothills of the forest, and finally Park Road 1802, which travels along the high ridge at the perimeter of the park, providing a great view of both the forest and the desert. 

Rhinos and one-horned lions are frequently sighted throughout the desert section of the park, and herds of gazelle roam the grassland parts of the desert section. Many endangered species live in the forest section, including Arenztopian kestrels, the Kerns giant river toad, the Arenztopian white-horned deer, and many others.
Arenztopian wombats live in the central area of the park. Many tour guides also offer bird-watching opportunities, and you can buy binoculars and bird-watching kits in the Park Store, which is located on the left right sfter you go into the park on Park Road 102.

There are many oasis settlements throughout the desert section and also lots of lodges in the forest section. One of the best is Kirkpatrick, Soninap and Sons. ($), a small lodge established in 1842 with many cabins nestled the shore of Lake Manninae. Their little restauraunt serves homey, warm food and bread, such as venison and wild potato sandwich garnished with pumpkin seed fresh and warm off the grill, wild boar and grilled onion salad with black eyed-beans, or wild turkey and basil stew with mustard plant garnished with lettuce. The cozy cabins have great access to the entire forest section of the park and are made of 500-year old birch trees. They are softly lighted at night and come with full utilities (shower, toilet, electricity, water, etc.) and many cabins have a full fireplace. Nightly rates average about 10-15 dollars. A more classy option in the desert section is Ernoae and Co. ($$), which is located in Dar-Ocaared Oasis at the eastern part of the desert region of the park. It's an early 1900s brick structure with many elegant suites. Its restauraunt serves traditional but progressive food such as cactus leaf and grilled lizard tail stew, or date and palm sap salad garnished with oregano. Nightly rates in their hotel range from 30-50 dollars.

More restauraunts include Dregak ($$$), which is a chic, luxury restauraunt housed in a large former airplane hangar at the foot of one of the hills in the forest section. They're known for their dedacent bell pepper and roasted sparrow soup and their crunchy mushroom and chickpea salad. A great choice if you're in the desert section is Emionak, Desfri, and Wesnab ($$), a 1956 restauraunt that provides light, traditional foods such as crunchy grilled wild artichoke salad with yam dressing, or a banana (yes, banana) and sandhopper bird wrapped in traditional thin palm wheat bread. A more rugged option is the Dansatia Lodge & Restauraunt ($$), a new restauraunt established in 2018. They are housed in a large wood building nestled in the heart of the forest section. Some of their staples include wild perch and boar sandwiches, or chickpea and pheasant stew seasoned with black pepper and oregano.
