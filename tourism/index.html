<em>5802 Arenztopia Boulevard Five</em></p>
<p>Hotel Reale
$$
This great hotel is very high-end and modern but has a reasonable price tag(400-600$ per night). It has moderate veiws, but unfortunatley is located in a high-traffic zone. It has a free shuttle to all major sites.
<em>1202 Texas Road</em></p>
<p>Hilton Arenztopia

A casual Hilton with great veiws but lots of traffic. Very close to the Dripping Cone Flagship store, and most tours of Arenztopia City begin there.

<p>Egyptian Obelisk $ A very tall obelisk that was bought from Egypt. It is in the center of Obelisk Plaza and next to the Egyptian Museum, which has lots of ancient statues, inscriptions, and jars, but no real mummies. It costs 3$ to go to all of these places at once.
