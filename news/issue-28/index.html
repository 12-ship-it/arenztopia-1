<h2 id="semi-truck-slams-into-building">Semi Truck Slams Into Building</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Downtown-A semi truck went out of control and slammed into the Wharton Park office building on ice-covered roads on 1st Street Monday. Thirteen people have died and a further twenty are in the hospital. According to security camera footage, the truck swerved around crazily before crashing violently into the office building, where it promptly exploded. Firefighters tried to control the fire until 2:00 in the morning on Tuesday. The fire was put out Tuesday afternoon. The building is not stable and may collapse; a 5,000-foot zone in and around the building has been evacuated and is currently closed while engineers assess the situation. The affected parts of the building include three small businesses and offices for Tvnrmr Medical. The small business owners are dead, along with four customers. The truck driver and five Tvnrmr Medical employees are also dead, and two other employees have since died from injuries. Two small business customers were injured, and the remaining 18 injured people are Tvnrmr Medical employees. The semi truck is operated by Qzmp Deliveries, and Qzmp has offered a &ldquo;sincere apology&rdquo; for this &ldquo;sad and horrifying accident.&rdquo; Detours can be taken via AR-14, AR-10, and AR-12. We will be publishing updates as new facts emerge.</p>

<p>Temperatures have dropped to -9 degrees celsius and we are starting to see major ice and snow buildup. Travel is strongly discouraged because there have already been multiple fatal crashes along the highway. Small power outages and water pipe failure have also been reported, although these are not forecasted to grow to a large scale. It is advised to let your faucets trickle and drip, because this prevents ice buildup in your water pipes. If you own snow chains, use them when travelling.</p>
<h2 id="coronavirus-report">Coronavirus Report</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>Cases have dropped to just 310, and deaths are at 7. The death count is now lower than the death count from mid March. The case count is now lower than the case count in early- and mid- April. A record 3,000 more people have gotten Avac, and another 1,500 have gotten Pfizer. So far, 5,000 people have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer and 5,575 people have gotten Avac, for a total of 10,575 people vaccinated with more to come. The Arenztopian Officer of Health, Dr. Johannes Peterson, has arranged for 20,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to be delivered to Arenztopia hopefully by mid- to late- March.</p>
