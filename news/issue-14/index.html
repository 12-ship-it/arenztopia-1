<h2 id="apais-2-reaches-asteroid">APAIS-2 reaches asteroid</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Derlass Space Facility-The revolutionary satellite APAIS-2 (All-Purpose Asteroid Imaging System) reached the asteroid Vesta on Tuesday after a journey of more than three years. It will orbit the asteroid for four Earth years collecting data about Vesta. This will help astronomers assess if Vesta will be suitable for a future mission. &ldquo;We are eyeing the Asteroid Belt as a potential destination for intergalactic explorers after stopping at Mars, which could become a &lsquo;gas station&rsquo; for future missions,&rdquo; the Arenztopian Officer of Science, Tony Yuan, said. APAIS-2 is the second satellite in the APAIS sieries. Its predecessor, APAIS-1, launched in 2008 and studied another asteroid, Pallas, until 2014.</p>

<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>The Political Politician is a news column that will run until New Year's Day, and it will cover the Arenztopian Elections.</p>
<p>As campaigning starts up a little bit, Tony Yuan and Ellidy J. have announced their intentions to run for Vice President. They represent the Science and Ethics parties, respectively. They are both running against each other and against independent incumbent Kassie K. Both Tony and Ellidy are also running for Mayor.

<p>Cases and deaths are still declining, with 867 confirmed cases and 53 deaths. The Arenztopian Officer of Health, Johannes Peterson, asked to have 15,000 doses of the new, promising Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and the doses are supposed to be delivered in early January 2021.</p>
<h2 id="feature-jack-ma">Feature: Jack Ma</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>We interviewed Jack Ma, the richest person in China and the owner of Ant Group, which is a subsidiary of his company Alibaba. Ant Group has announced its intentions to start a massive, 626 billion Arenzo IPO sometime next week.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: So tell us a little bit about your upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>Jack Ma: So first I want to tell people what an IPO is. It's an event where a company goes public, basically. So what everybody means by biggest IPO is that Ant Group is going to be worth the most money when it goes public.</p>
<p>OCA: What are the potential implications of this IPO?</p>
<p>JM: So first, it would add a lot more value to the Chinese stock market. Also, it would hopefully make Ant Group or ALibaba grow in size through trading.</p>
<p>OCA: What are you planning to do with all the extra money, if there is any?</p>
<p>JM: I want to give it to small buisenesses; they're the ones who need it the mot, espcially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>OCA: Thanks! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!</p>
<p>JM: Thank you!</p>
